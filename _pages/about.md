I’m **Joykirat Singh**, currently a **Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India**, working under the mentorship of [Dr. Akshay Nambi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QolzyE4AAAAJ&hl=en).

I graduated in 2023 with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Design with a silver medal for academic excellance from the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Delhi, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with [Dr. Md Shad Akhtar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=KUcO6LAAAAAJ&hl=en).

Previously, I served as a **Research Assistant** at the **Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi**, working alongside [Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=C5S9JnIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Soumen Chakrabarti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LfF2zfQAAAAJ&hl=en) on various research projects.

I have also worked as a Software Developer at Expedia, where I developed and maintained backend payment services. Additionally, during the summer of 2021, I was a student developer with **Google Summer of Code**.

My research primarily focuses on **reverse engineering Large Language Models (LLMs)** through mechanistic interpretability, **enhancing their reasoning capabilities** and **exploring their self-evaluating and self-correcting abilities** to enable learning through feedback. I’m passionate about understanding the internal workings of LLMs and developing methods to improve their accuracy and efficiency, particularly in complex reasoning tasks.
