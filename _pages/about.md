I'm Joykirat Singh, currently a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, working under the guidance of Dr. Akshay Nambi. I graduated in 2023 with a Bachelor's degree from the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi, where I collaborated with Dr. Md Shad Akhtar on various projects. More recently, I served as a Research Assistant at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, working with Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty.

My research focuses on reverse engineering Large Language Models (LLMs) through mechanistic interpretability and enhancing their reasoning capabilities. I'm passionate about understanding the internal workings of LLMs and developing methods to improve their accuracy and efficiency, particularly in complex reasoning tasks. I also had the chance to work at as Software Developer at Expedia, where I developed and maintained the backend of Payment Module. In Summer of 2021, I was contributed to Google Summer of Code.
